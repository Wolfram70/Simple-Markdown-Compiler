# A Markdown Parser using Lex and Yacc

Note: This is a new README for the 'dev' branch.

This is a simple parser for markdown designed using lex and yacc. Flex has been used for lexical analysis and bison for syntax parsing. The following tags have been implemented:
### 1. Paragraphs
The  &lt;p> and &lt;/p> tags can be used to enclose paragraphs to automatically indent the first line and insert a newline after the last line. A paragraph can be started with $ to prevent the inital indentation on the first line like so: <b>&lt;p>$ ...&lt;/p></b>
### 2. Line Breaks
Line breaks can be inserted in the middle of any string with the &lt;br> tag which inserts a new line when parsed.
### 3. Headings
Headings can be written by prefixing a string with tag and enclosing it by curly braces like <b>#{insert_heading_here}</b>. The heading when displayed in stdout is displayed completely in uppercase to indicate that it is a heading. <br>
### 4. Lists
Lists can be declared with the &lt;list> and &lt;/list> tags. New items can be added with the &lt;si> tag inside a list. Whenever a new item is to being written, it should be started with &lt;si> to parse it as such. For example, <br>
<b>&lt;list>&lt;si>one &lt;si>two&lt;/list></b> will be parsed as: <br>
1. one
2. two<br>

## Instructions to run
 
The executable can be generated by running <code>make</code> in cmd or terminal (after changing the appropriate commands in the makefile) and running <code>make clean</code> after it to delete all the intermediate files.

## Things to work on
- Resolving issue with parsing simple string input (with no tags).
- Informative error messages for syntax errors (currently the process just terminates upon being unable to correctly parse the input).
- Support for hyperlinks and tables.
